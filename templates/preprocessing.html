    <h1>Preprocessing</h1>
    <p>Preprocessing is the first step in the data analysis pipeline. It involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis. This can involve removing missing values, normalizing the data, and encoding categorical variables.</p>
    <p>There are many different preprocessing techniques that can be used, depending on the nature of the data and the analysis that is being performed. Some common preprocessing techniques include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Removing missing values</li>
        <li>Normalizing the data</li>
        <li>Encoding categorical variables</li>
        <li>Feature scaling</li>
        <li>Feature selection</li>
    </ul>
